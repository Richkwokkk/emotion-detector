# Final Project: Emotion Detection Application

This is the final project for the **Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask** course on Coursera. This project aims to demonstrate knowledge and skills in application creation and web deployment.

## Project Overview

The project involves developing an emotion detection application using the Watson AI libraries and deploying it as a web application with Flask. The application will analyze text input to identify underlying emotions, providing a user-friendly output format.

## Project Tasks

To successfully complete this project, there are 8 tasks that need to be performed:

### Task 1: Clone the Project Repository
Clone the original project repository to your local environment for the necessary code and resources.  

### Task 2: Create an Emotion Detection Application
Utilize the Watson NLP library to develop an application that analyzes text input and identifies the emotions present.

### Task 3: Format the Output
Ensure the output of the emotion detection application is well-formatted and user-friendly, allowing users to understand the identified emotions.

### Task 4: Package the Application
Prepare the application for deployment with clear and concise instructions.

### Task 5: Run Unit Tests
Thoroughly test the application to ensure it functions as expected. Create unit tests to validate its behavior.

### Task 6: Deploy as a Web Application Using Flask
Deploy the emotion detection application as a web application using the Flask framework, making it accessible over the internet.

### Task 7: Incorporate Error Handling
Implement robust error handling to manage unexpected situations gracefully.

### Task 8: Run Static Code Analysis
Perform static code analysis to review the code for potential issues, ensuring adherence to best practices and code quality.
